    "## Learning objectives:\n",
    "- Understand how to read in, format and analyse rainfall data from different sources\n",
    "- Calculate and interpret basic statistics to compare gridded rainfall estimates and rain gauge observations \n",
    "- Learn how to test and scale up research code\n",
    "\n",
    "# Introduction\n",
    "Rainfall is notoriously difficult to measure accurately, but in the UK we have a dense network of both [rain gauges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_gauge) and [rain radar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_radar) stations (**Figure 1**). These network gives us a relatively reliable and consistent estimate of rainfall through time, even when there is missing or wrong data, because estimates are cross-checked agaisnt other nearby measurements. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Map of UK rain gauge stations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NERC-CEH/UKCEH_Summer_School/refs/heads/main/content/Maps-of-daily-rain-gauges-used-to-derive-the-CEH-GEAR-data-set-a-monthly-rain-gauges.png)  \n",
    "*Figure 1. Maps of daily rain gauges in 2012: (a) monthly rain gauges and (b) daily rain gauges (source: Keller et al. 2015).*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The UKCEH is also working-on a updated interactive map of the UK's rain gauge network (as of 2025), which you can find a version of [here](https://thomasjkeel.github.io/UK-Rain-Gauge-Network/gauges.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Gridded rainfall data\n",
    "> *Gridded rainfall products provide a spatially- and temporally-uniform estimate of rainfall*\n",
    "\n",
    "Whilst, the UK's rain gauge network provides valuable data, its coverage is both spatially and temporally uneven. Some areas—such as Scotland—have a much denser concentration of gauges than others, like the South of England (see Figure 1). Additionally, the gauges themselves vary in age and data quality.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As such, it can be inconvenient to work with rain gauge data. For this reason, environmental researchers often prefer datasets that are interpolated onto regular grids, which are easier to process, analyze, and compare over space and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the UK, two main gridded rainfall products exist:  \n",
    "1. CEH-GEAR — provides daily/monthly 1km gridded rainfall, produced by the UKCEH and described in [Keller et al. 2015](https://essd.copernicus.org/articles/7/143/2015/)\n",
    "2. HadUK-Grid — provides daily/monthly/seasonal/annual 1km gridded rainfall, produced by the Met Office and described in [Hollis et al. 2019](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/gdj3.78)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each product provides slightly different methodology for spatially interpolating data from the UK rain gauge network to a regular 1km grid, shown diagramatically in Figure 2 (see more in those papers if you are interested in the specifics). For this practical, we will be using the CEH-GEAR dataset, but for future, you can access the HadUK-Grid [here](https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/4dc8450d889a491ebb20e724debe2dfb/)).\n",
