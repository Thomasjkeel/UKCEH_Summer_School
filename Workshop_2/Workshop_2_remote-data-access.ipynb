Manual Data Downloading\n","Direct data download refers to the process of retrieving datasets from a remote server via a straightforward HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP/SFTP link. This method is commonly used when data are stored as static files (e.g., NetCDF, CSV, GRIB) and made accessible through a direct URL. Users can download files manually through a browser. While this approach is simple and widely supported, it may be less efficient for accessing large datasets or performing repeated queries on multiple files, in which case more advanced methods may be preferable. Some tools are available, such as [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/), for accessing FTP/SFTP servers for bulk downloads.\n","\n","***Demonstration examples:***\n","\n","https://environment.data.gov.uk/hydrology/explore\n","\n","https://portal.grdc.bafg.de/applications/public.html?publicuser=PublicUser#dataDownload/Home\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"3-vECW7DaLPf"},"source":["<a id='cl_downloading'></a>\n","# 2.2. Command Line Downloading\n","\n","Datasets hosted on remote servers can be downloaded via HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP links using command-line tools in Linux. These methods are especially useful for automating bulk downloads from static URLs. With Linux shell scripting, such downloads can also be parallelised to efficiently handle multiple files simultaneously. This method downloads the full data available via the link being used, and most of the time cannot download subsets of one file.\n","\n","[Parallel computing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-science-fundamentals/introduction-to-parallel-computing/) can significantly speed up the process of downloading large numbers of files from the command line. Instead of downloading files one at a time, multiple downloads can be done simultaneously, making efficient use of available CPU and network resources. This approach is especially useful when working with large datasets with multiple files or when accessing data from remote servers with high latency (i.e., delay in communication between your computer and the remote server).\n","\n","***Demonstration examples:***\n","\n","https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/documents/dbf13dd5-90cd-457a-a986-f2f9dd97e93c\n","\n","https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Uc-WWEvhm_gE"},"source":["*Note: The ! operator in Python-based Jupyter Notebooks allows users to execute Linux shell commands directly from within the notebook, effectively stepping out of the Python environment to run system-level commands.*"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"K_fwJxCqatFU"},"source":["### (i) Downloading single file"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"_F8lHLmZ6SL_"},"outputs":[],"source":["!wget https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/datastore/eidchub/dbf13dd5-90cd-457a-a986-f2f9dd97e93c/GB/monthly/CEH_GEAR_monthly_GB_1894.nc"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"go6bwCSGDloD"},"outputs":[],"source":["# For now we are deleting the data\n","!rm CEH_GEAR_monthly_GB_1894.nc"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"6RApmhhGa1OU"},"source":["### (ii) Downloading restricted data"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"TAXwig0o6pxi"},"outputs":[],"source":["# To use wget for multiple files or even ftp servers which are linked to your account and password protected you can use the following version\n","# For detailed example of accessing servers with password protection please see: https://eidc.ac.uk/help/getdata/downloadData\n","# Add your own username and password to download the whole catalogue.\n","# Please do not try this during the training session as it would take a lot time and storage space.\n","!wget --user=YOUR_USERNAME --password=YOUR_PASSWORD --auth-no-challenge https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/datastore/eidchub/dbf13dd5-90cd-457a-a986-f2f9dd97e93c"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"xDZM4EkybIQ8"},"source":["### (iii) Downloading multiple files"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"vpo6PT5e97OR"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Multiple files can be available to us sometimes in compressed format like the following\n","!wget https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/hourly_precip-3240/01/3240_01_1948-1998.tar.Z"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"5VUkKI36eSzw"},"outputs":[],"source":["%%capture\n","# There are command line methods to uncompress the datasets\n","!tar -zxvf 3240_01_1948-1998.tar.Z"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"cuhDYIV9Ak0X"},"outputs":[],"source":["# For now we are deleting the data\n","!rm 3240_*"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"cIKKbv_ACDkt"},"outputs":[],"source":["# To download multiple files via wget, you can use a txt file that has a list of the URLs\n","# First as an example we create a txt file with urls we want to download\n","url_list = ['https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/daily-grids/beta/by-month/1951/01/prcp-195101-cen-scaled.csv',\n","            'https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/daily-grids/beta/by-month/1952/01/prcp-195201-cen-scaled.csv']\n","\n","with open(\"urls.txt\", \"w\") as outfile:\n","    outfile.write(\"\\n\".join(url_list))\n","\n","!more urls.txt"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"_kZO4roRRUQl"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Then use the text file with the URL list to download multiple files\n","!wget -i urls.txt"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"5QO5lc9HDdl5"},"outputs":[],"source":["# For now we are deleting the data\n","!rm prcp* urls.txt"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"bwDm7F2IRXG4"},"source":["<a id='remote_access'></a>\n","# 2.3.

These are often integrated with cloud platforms, allowing users to search and access data programmatically with minimal overhead. For example, [ECMWF Data Stores STAC Catalogue API](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/stac-browser/?.language=en).\n","  - Sensor Observation Services (SOS) are also available and are particularly useful for accessing real-time or near-real-time observations, especially from in-situ sensor networks or environmental monitoring platforms. For example, [UK AIR](https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/data-availability). In the near future, the [FDRI project](https://fdri.org.uk/) will provide monitoring data covering the whole hydrological system.\n","  - Finally, platforms such as [Google Earth Engine (GEE)](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets) and other open data cube frameworks enable users to query and analyze massive gridded datasets remotely, leveraging built-in computational resources—eliminating the need to download data locally. The GEE platform offers [comprehensive tutorials](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/getstarted) that guide users through its functionality. As a self-learning exercise, we have included a GitHub repository developed at UKCEH, linked in this workshop’s directory. It provides step-by-step training on [extracting drought indicators using GEE in Python](https://github.com/eugmag/Google_Earth_Engine_python_demo/tree/main), allowing you to follow along at your own pace."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"smOBw4UxAiI8"},"source":["# Thank you!
