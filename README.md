# UKCEH Summer School - Data Driven Approaches to Hydrological Science
Welcome to the **UKCEH Summer School** on *Data Driven Approaches to Hydrological Science*. 

This series of hands-on workshops introduces the fundamentals of accessing, modelling, and analysing hydrological data and approaches. Each session is designed to build practical skills through guided exercises and additional resources. Below you will find brief summaries of each workshop, along with links to the corresponding resources that we will explore together during the training.

These notebooks were developed for the UKCEH Summer School and are intended to be used interactively during the training sessions. The materials are designed to be run on [Google Colab](https://colab.google/), which allows you to get started quickly without any local setup.
  
However, you're very welcome to explore the notebooks at your own pace and on a different platform of your choice, as long as the required packages are installed correctly. If you would like help setting up the environment on your local machine or another platform, we are happy to provide support.

## Training Objectives
The high-level objectives of this summer school are:
- Introduce fundamental concepts in water resources modelling
- Demonstrate how to access and work with remote datasets using Python
- Provide an overview of key datasets commonly used in hydrological science
- Offer hands-on experience with standard tools and packages through practical applications

## Running the Training Notebooks on Google Colab
To run the training notebooks using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), follow these steps:
1. **Log in to your Google account** and open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. In Colab, go to **File > Open notebook**.
3. Select the **GitHub** tab.
4. Paste the URL of the specific notebook (ending in `.ipynb`) from this repository into the search bar.
5. Click on the notebook you want to open.

> **Important:** Before you start editing, make sure to **Save a copy to your own Google Drive**.

6. Go to **File > Save a copy in Drive**. This will open a new tab with the title `Copy of <Notebook Name>`.
7. You are now working on your own copy of the notebook, which you can rename if you choose.
8. You can safely close the original (read-only) notebook tab and continue working on your personal copy.
9. The copied notebook will be saved in your Google Drive and can be accessed anytime.
10. ???include about the requirement.txt if they need to run it somewhere else???

## Introduction to the Workshops
This series of four interactive workshops is designed to introduce participants to data-driven approaches in hydrological science. Each session focuses on a specific aspect of working with hydrological data, from modelling concepts to accessing, exploring, and applying datasets in research contexts.

### Workshop 0: Intro to Git
**Facilitators:** *Simon Stanley*

This workshop will have hands-on Git exercises designed to help you practise essential version control skills. It looks at common workflows such as commiting, branching and merging, as well as touching on the use of remote repositories. The GitHub repo used for this workshop is [intro-to-git-exercises](https://github.com/NERC-CEH/intro-to-git-exercises).

### Workshop 1: Approaches to Hydrological Modelling
**Facilitators:** *Nathan Rickards | Helen Baron*

### Workshop 2: Accessing remote hydrological data
**Facilitators:** *Amulya Chevuturi | Matt Dalle Piagge | Tom Keel | Kit Macleod | Matt Fry*

Follow-along session on accessing and retrieving remote hydrological datasets using Python, including common tools and protocols for working with data hosted on public or institutional servers. ???LINK TO NOTEBOOK???


### Workshop 3: Exploring hydrological data
**Facilitators:** *Matt Dalle Piagge | Tom Keel | Amulya Chevuturi | Kit Macleod | Matt Fry*

Hands-on session on exploring different types of hydroclimate datasets, including basic techniques for processing, visualisation, and analysis. ???LINK TO NOTEBOOK???


### Workshop 4: Researching with hydrological data
**Facilitators:** *Tom Keel | Amulya Chevuturi | Matt Dalle Piagge | Kit Macleod | Matt Fry*

Do it yourself session with guidance on using hydrological data into research workflows, with a focus on applications and good data practices. ???LINK TO NOTEBOOK???

### Workshop 5: Creating FAIR Outputs
**Facilitators:** *Jasmine Hunter | Els Dhiedt*
